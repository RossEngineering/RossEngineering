# Contributing to RossEngineering

Thanks for taking an interest in contributing. This organisation focuses on small-to-mid sized systems that prioritise clarity, correctness, and long-term maintainability.

## Ways to Contribute

- Report bugs with clear reproduction steps
- Suggest improvements with reasoning and trade-offs
- Propose small, well-scoped features that align with each repo’s goals
- Improve documentation, examples, or tests

## Before You Open an Issue

Please include:

- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened (include error messages/logs if relevant)
- Steps to reproduce (minimal repro preferred)
- Environment details (OS, runtime versions, database/provider, etc.)
- Any relevant configuration (redact secrets)

If you’re unsure whether something is a bug or a question, use Discussions where available.

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Scope
Keep PRs focused. Prefer one meaningful change per PR:
- one bug fix, or
- one small feature, or
- one refactor with a clear goal

If you want to propose a larger change, open an issue or discussion first describing:
- the problem
- the approach
- alternatives considered
- impact on existing behaviour

### Quality
PRs should:
- include tests where behaviour changes
- maintain existing style and conventions
- avoid “drive-by” formatting changes unrelated to the goal
- update docs/README when public behaviour changes

### Commit messages
Use clear, descriptive commits. A simple convention is fine:
- `fix: ...`
- `feat: ...`
- `refactor: ...`
- `docs: ...`
- `test: ...`

## Security

If you find a security issue, please do not open a public issue.
Raise it privately (e.g., via GitHub Security Advisories if enabled) with enough detail to reproduce.

## Licensing

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same licence as the repository.
